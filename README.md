# Coronavirus Twitter Analysis Project

Scanning all geotagged tweets sent in 2020 to monitor for the spread of the coronavirus on social media.

**Key Concepts:**

1. Working with large scale datasets
1. Working with multilingual text
1. Using the MapReduce divide-and-conquer paradigm to create parallel code

## Background

Approximately 500 million tweets are sent everyday. Of those tweets, about 1% are *geotagged*. That is, the user's device includes location information about where the tweets were sent from. In this project, I analayzed a dataset of all geotagged tweets that were sent in 2020, roughly 1.1 billion tweets. My findings can be found in the 'viz' folder, which includes the total number of appearances of various keywords on Twitter in 2020.
